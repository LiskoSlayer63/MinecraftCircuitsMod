This week my goal was to learn Minecraft Forge and start working on designing basic blocks, the FrameBlock and the ControlBlock.  As I was working, I found an
example repository that had examples to aid in learning the utility.
Even with the use of these examples, I was able to place blocks in the game world, but not load the textures properly.  I have not yet learned how the texture loading
is handled, but when I ran the sample by itself it seemed to work just fine.  I feel that I did not make as much progress as I should, especially since I was suppoed
to have made a portal using the FrameBlocks, even though it has nowhere to go yet.

Progress had been delayed, largely because I was still learning the programs associated with modding minecraft.  In particular, I was chasing around a texture
rendering issue that I just found out yesterday was a simple, easily fixed typo. But now I have a system for rendering blocks in the world, which is an
essential part of the project.  
It also didn't help anything that the partition of my hard drive containing the program decided to stop booting properly.  While I was able to fix it, I was
unable to commit as much as I would have liked to a week ago.  I was able to fix the problem and then continue committing as planned.  
I also learned that the most recent version of minecraft, 1.10, is only about 4 months old.  Because of that, documentation pertaining to this version in particular
has been rather scarce.  Continued research has paid off, however, and I have found tutorials that allowed me to create a foundational structure for a portal.  Now, 
since the portal has nowhere to go yet, I cannot fully complete it, but the structure is there now, and this will help down the road.

Circuit implementation has continued, and I noticed that there is a flaw in the documentation for this project.  In particular, 
when writing the ABBA circuit, I did not make note of what m and n meant in the mathematical expressions for time.  In addition,
I have yet to acquire full understanding of the interface, which I should do in order to ensure correct manipulation of the numbers/booleans
that come into the circuit.

I've continued to investigate portals and I actually found a lead I can use.  While still untested, I can confirm that as of today I have a buildable implementation,
AND a backdoor in the form of a custom command that can be used to enter the dimension at will.  
I don't know why, but I seem to be struggling on the circuits implementation.  I've read the interface over, but I'm still not sure how I should be approaching this.
At this stage, I think it would help if the two of us both sat down to look at it.

This week the goal was to rig the dimension generator so we could load the same surroundings each time, an important step in getting our puzzle dimension to work. 
I played with it for a while and made an attempt at a solution through manipulation of the AnvilChunkLoader, a Minecraft class that loads data from files generated
by the game.  It took a couple of meetings to actually fully understand it, and even then, while it was my task to solve the problem, Alex ultimately solved it.  
It feels good that this got done, but at the same time I wish I had a thorough enough understanding of the Minecraft technology that I could have solved the problem.
Next, I believe the goal is to actually get the framework for the dimension working.

I began construction on a puzzle that we would use to demonstrate the And circuit.  However, I'm not sure how exactly I need to proceed because I am not sure about 
what block specifically will channel the AND circuit yet. I'm pretty sure that at the time of my writing this, that was still in development.  But now that I'm
thinking about it a little more, I can still endeavor to lay the framework for the puzzle, and then go even further once the necessary pieces are set.  This sounds
like a thing I should do today.  Other things I learned how to do include getting a dimension to generate an empty chunk, and how to make a block clean your inventory
and warp you to a fixed position.  What surprises me is that when th project begain, it took me two weeks to properly render a block, and now I can do it in less than
an hour.  I suppose that means that I'm learning the technology finally.

I started building the framework for puzzles in the puzzle dimension.  I managed
to build puzzle frameworks for most combinatorial circuits.  I plan to expand the puzzles
once we are 100% sure of what the objective of each one will be.
I'm getting kind of tired of working separately on this project.  I feel like if we're going to
get it done well at this point, we need to be working jointly on this project, in the same room,
for multiple hours.

I created a new branch to ease debugging issues we seemed to be having.  I named it debugging.  I worry for the
state of the project and am not sure if we will finish.
