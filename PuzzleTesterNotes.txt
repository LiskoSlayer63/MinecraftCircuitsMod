Generate a sequence of inputs to the ciruit, and if the results match the expexted sequence,
the player has passed the puzzle. 

Create a reflective tile entity for a tester block that would store what circuit its expecting to
test and the current position the output block belongs to.
This tile entity would use the reflective calling code to determine which circuit it is testing.

An editor can set the block tag, and then the code will use the tag to find 
where the folder is that contains the testing implementation.
