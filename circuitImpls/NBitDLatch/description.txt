NBitDLatch(n):

A D-latch with an n-bit "Data" input and a 1-bit "Control" input. While the "Control" input is low, the output of this circuit is just its input. After the "Control" input hits a rising edge, this circuit maintains its output value so long as the "Control" value is high, regardless of its input.

Example [NBitDLatch(1)]:

~_~_~~~~____ Data
_____~~~~_~~ Control
_~_~_~~~~~__ Output

------------->
Redstone ticks

where '~' denotes a high signal
and '_' denotes a low signal
