HalfAdder():

This circuit has a redstone "A" input on its back and a redstone "B" input on its right, with two redstone outputs "C" and "S" on its left and front, respectively.

If "a" and "b" are the numerical values (0 or 1) of the inputs on A and B, this circuit computes Sum = a + b. C ("carry-out") is then set to the high-order bit of the sum, and S ("sum") is set to the low-order bit of the sum.

Truth table:
A B  C S
0 0  0 0
0 1  0 1
1 0  0 1
1 1  1 0
