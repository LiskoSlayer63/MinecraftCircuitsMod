Half-Adder

This circuit is not configurable.
This circuit has two 1-bit inputs and two 1-bit outputs.

The circuit takes in 1-bit input and 1 carry-in input and adds them together
to produce results on output.  One output carries the result, and the carry-out
output will be on if a bit was carried out of the result.

A carry out occurs if both inputs are on, since 1 + 1 = 10 in binary, so 1 bit
will be carried out.
