SPLITTER circuit:

A splitter has a configurable bitwidth, n.
A splitter has one n-bit input and two n-bit outputs.
It takes the n-bit input and splits it among the two outputs.

The high bits go to the left side of the splitter and the low bits go to the
left side.

This is the opposite of a Combiner.
