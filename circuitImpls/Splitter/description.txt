Splitter(n):

This circuit takes a single n-bit input and splits it into two (n/2)-bit outputs.

This is done according to the usual convention -- the n lowest-order bits (those with a small place value) in the input are passed right of the fork, and the n highest-order bits (those with a large place value) in the input are passed left of the fork. 

See Combiner((n/2)), which performs the opposite operation
