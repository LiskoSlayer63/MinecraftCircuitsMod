Xor(n):

Computes the bitwise exclusive or of its two n-bit inputs, meaning that a bit at a given position in the output bus will be high only if one, and only one bit in the corresponding position of its two inputs is high.

Example [Xor(1)]:

Truth table:

A B  Output
0 0  0
0 1  1
1 0  1
1 1  0

Note: Xor can be thought of as "addition modulo 2", just like how And can be thought of as "multiplication modulo 2".
