Multiplexer:

This circuit has a configurable bitwidth n.
this circuit has two n-bit inputs on its left and right, 
one 1-bit input, and 1 n-bit output.

A multiplexer decides which input to send to the output based on its switching
input.  If the switching input is high, the left input will be forwarded,
and if the switch is low, the right output will be forwarded.
