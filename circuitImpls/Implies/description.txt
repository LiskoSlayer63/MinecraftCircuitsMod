Implies(n):

Given two n-bit inputs A and B (left and right, respectively), this computes the bitwise implies of A and B. 

Example [Implies(1)]:
Truth-table:

A B  Output
0 0  1
0 1  1
1 0  0
1 1  1

Note that the result is only false (low signal) if "A" was true, but "B" was false. One interpretation of this is that we only have evidence that A doesn't imply B if we can observe a case where A is true, but B is not.
