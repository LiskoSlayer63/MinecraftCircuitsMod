Implies circuit:

This circuit has a configurable bitwidth n.
This circuit takes in two n-bit inputs and has 1 n-bit output.

This circuit will perform bitwise implies operations on the inputs.

Example:
For a 1-bit implies circuit with two inputs A and B and an output O, 
the truth table is:

A 1 0 1 0
B 0 0 1 1
O 0 1 1 1

This circuit can also be written as Not-A OR B.
