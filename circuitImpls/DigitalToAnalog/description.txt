DigitalToAnalog():

This circuit takes a 4-bit bused input and outputs a redstone signal with strength (0-15) equal to the numerical value of the input. 

Examples:
1111 on input -> full-strength redstone signal on output

0101 on input -> strength 5 redstone signal on output

0000 on input -> no redstone signal on output

See AnalogToDigital() for a circuit which does the opposite
