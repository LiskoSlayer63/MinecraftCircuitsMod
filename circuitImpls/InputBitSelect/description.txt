InputBitSelect(i, n) circuit:

A circuit which takes a single redstone input and sets the ith bit of an n-bit output bus to the logical or of its existing value in the bus with this circuit's redstone input. 

Following the usual convention, the 0th position is the lowest-order bit (smallest place value), and the (n-1)th position is the highest-order bit (largest place value)

See OutputBitSelect(i, n), which does the opposite and reads a bit in the ith position from an n-bit bus.
