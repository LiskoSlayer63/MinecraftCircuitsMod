OutputBitSelect(i, n):

A circuit which takes a single n-bit input and outputs the ith bit of the input, where the 0th position is the lowest-order bit (smallest place value) and the (n-1)th position is the highest-order bit (largest place value)

See InputBitSelect(i, n), which does the opposite and inserts a bit into the ith position of a n-bit bus.
