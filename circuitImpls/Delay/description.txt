Delay(T,N) circuit

This circuit has a single N-bit input and a single N-bit output,
with the output set as the input delayed by T redstone ticks.

Example [Delay(3, 1)]:

___~_~_~_____ Input
______~_~_~__ Output

------------->
Redstone ticks

where '~' denotes a high signal
and '_' denotes a low signal
