Combiner(n):

This circuit takes two n-bit inputs and combines them into a single 2n-bit bus.

This is done according to the usual convention -- the n lowest-order bits (those with a small place value) in the output come from input on the right, and the n highest-order bits (those with a large place value) in the output come from the input on the left.

See Splitter(2n), which performs the opposite operation
