The process of generating tests reflectively is pretty much the same as invoking
circuits reflectively, but I would use a TestGeneratorInvoker instead of a 
ChipInvoker.

For direct connections, I could borrow behavior from the CTE regarding them,
but I would need to make sure I have search code for testing buses that are 
under test, but not right next to the testing tile entity.
