(also ChipInvoker.java)

Progress for the week ending in 10/7/16:
-Finalized reflective calling code for circuits (ChipInvoker.java)
-Finalized reflective calling code for circuit testers (TestGeneratorInvoker.java)
-Put both under a common abstract superclass (Invoker)

Progress for the week ending in 10/14/16:
-Helped Sean try to track down the cause of the control block's
missing texture in the inventory

of moving things over into circuitsMod
-Created an initial version of a bus block


...Fast forward... (intervening entries to be filled on merge)
Progress for the week ending in 11/4/16:
-Performed work to integrate Circuit Tile Entity logic with the
Bus Network logic. Works in theory, but still's gotta be tested.
