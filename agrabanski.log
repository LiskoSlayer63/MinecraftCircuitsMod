Progress for the week ending in 9/30/16:
-Finalized the Circuit API (now as a long comment in ChipInvoker.java)
-Wrote an initial version of the reflective calling code for circuits
(also ChipInvoker.java)

Progress for the week ending in 10/7/16:
-Finalized reflective calling code for circuits (ChipInvoker.java)
-Finalized reflective calling code for circuit testers (TestGeneratorInvoker.java)
-Put both under a common abstract superclass (Invoker)
-Added tests for both classes
-Fixed functionality so all tests pass

Progress for the week ending in 10/14/16:
-Helped Sean try to track down the cause of the control block's
missing texture in the inventory
-Helped with logistics (build, repository consistency, etc.)
of moving things over into circuitsMod
-Created an initial version of a bus block

Note:
-The order of things as in the Gantt chart will likely change -- I will
spend this next week working on developing the protocol for bus networks,
and then will begin work on the Circuit Tile Entity. This is desirable
because the operation of the tile entity will likely be closely
tied to the operation of buses.

Up next:
-Flesh out bus network code
-Begin work on the Circuit Tile Entity code
