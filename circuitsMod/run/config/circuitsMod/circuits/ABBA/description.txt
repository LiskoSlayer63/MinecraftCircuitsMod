ABBA Circuit:

This circuit has configuration options:
How long Output A is on
How long Output B is on while A is on.

An ABBA Circuit has one 1-bit input and two 1-bit outputs, A and B.
When the circuit detects a pulse, ouput A will activate and remain on for the
set length of time.  During this time, B will activate and remain on for the
specified time.  

The trick to this circuit is to remember that B CANNOT be On while A is Off.
