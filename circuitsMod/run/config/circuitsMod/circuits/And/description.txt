This block is an And circuit. 

The first configuration option for And is the bitwidth of the circuit, n.
An And gate has two n-bit inputs and one n-bit output.
The output is the bitwise And of the two inputs.  

Example:
For two 1-bit inputs A and B and output O, the truth table is:

A 1 0 1 0
B 0 0 1 1
O 0 0 1 0

where 1 is high and 0 is low.
