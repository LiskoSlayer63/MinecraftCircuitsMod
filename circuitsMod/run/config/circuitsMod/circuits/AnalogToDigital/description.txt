Analog to Digital Converter:

This circuit is not configurable.
It takes in four 1-bit inputs and has 1 four bit output.  

The circuit will output the signal value corresponding to the 4-bit binary
value of the signal passed in.  

Example:
Suppose you set all four inputs to be on.  The circuit will send out a signal
value of 15, since 1111 is 15 in binary.

Or, suppose you set the second input high and all the rest low.  The output
value will be 2, since 0010 is 2 in binary.
