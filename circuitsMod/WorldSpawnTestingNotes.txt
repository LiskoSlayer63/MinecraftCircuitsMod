Coordinates that I spawned on: 
XYZ: -255.500 70.00000 -16.500

I entered the dimension on the same square by looking down and placing the block
at my feet.  

Coordinates at which I entered the dimension: -255.500 73.00000 -17.000. 

I placed blocks straight, directly in front of me in order to mark whether
chunk generation succeeds.  

Something I noticed is that the r.x.y.mca files are generated differently each 
time.  I'm not sure why that is.  By this I mean x and y become different values.

I copied and pasted them into the source directory.
