How to play:
You probably want the Downloads tab. See the official wiki (http://minecraft-circuits-mod.wikia.com/wiki/Minecraft_Circuits_Mod_Wiki) for detailed installation instructions.

Contributing/Repository organization:
This repository is organized like a standard Minecraft Forge project, with the following basic conventions:

-Default circuit implementations go in the circuitImpls directory
-If there are higher-res versions of graphic resources available than are used in the game, put them into the artworks directory

Now go forth and contribute! If you have questions about the source, feel free to shoot an e-mail over to spagrab@gmail.com (for direct communication) or add an "x is difficult to understand" issue. Thanks!
